# Patterns

**The Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**The Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**The Decorator Pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
